# Journey West

by Kalloyan Stoyanov and Adam Johnson

# Elevator Pitch

In Journey West, players will take on the role of a child in a family that is heading west in the 1840's. Along the way, they will play through mini games that are related to the time period as well as geographic locations in the United States. Players will learn how life in the 1840's compares to life in modern society. This is an introductory game for 1st-3rd graders to gain general knowledge of the time period that will help them in US or American History classes in the future.

# Basic Instructions

Players will start in NY and begin their journey west. Complete each point and play through the scenes to reach California and (hopefully) strike GOLD!

Each mini-game has their own set of instructions/movements that use mouse movements and mouse clicks.
