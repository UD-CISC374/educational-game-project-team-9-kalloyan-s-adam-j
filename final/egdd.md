# Journey West

## Elevator Pitch

The purpose of our game is for players to experience the life of a family traveling west in the late 1840's in search of a better opportunity. The players should get a sense of what it may have been like to live during that time through various scenes and mini games producing a campaign-like experience. This game hopes to teach players why people migrated west, and how life today differs from life back then. There are not many other similar games regarding Manifest Destiny, but the ones that exist target an older audience and place a greater emphasis on the hardships of the time.

## Influences (Brief)
- Oregon Trail
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: This game is an influence because it tells a similar story of migration during the time of Manifest Destiny. However, this game differs because it takes a more serious approach of the time and places greater emphasis on the difficulty settlers had to face.
- Subway Surfer:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: This game is an influence because it is quite addictive running through a trainyard with the intention of getting a high score. As your character runs, the pace of the game increases making it more challenging and likely that the player will run into an obstacle and get caught by the guard. It serves as inspiration for one of the mini games.
- Temple Run
  - Medium: game
  - Explanation: Temple Run is an influence because in this game players progress through a course with various obstacles that the player must maneuver around. In our game, one of the mini games would be to sail a boat down the Mississip River while avoiding obstacles.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Mini game 1:
  - Use the mouse to catch beavers
  - Beavers and other animals randomly pop up on the screen
  - Clicking on the other animals risks scaring away the beavers
- Mini game 2:
  - Sail a boat using mouse
  - Crashing into obstacles will damage the boat
  - Obstacles will float down vertically
  - 3 crashes and the player must restart the mini game
- Mini game 3 :
  - Use the mouse to move a pan
  - Gold and other debris will flow down a stream
  - When a piece of gold collides with the pan it will be collected
  - When debris hits the pan it disables it for a short period of time
- General
  - Select point on map to start level
  - Progress through game by beating the mini games

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

  - Migration West in the 1800's 
  - Idea of Manifest Destiny

## Target Audiences

- 1st grade - 3rd grade because the game will feature light hearted mini games to tell a story

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

Since the mini games will be relatively simple and intuitive there will be a quick tutorial before the mini game fully initiates.

## Presentation of Content

By playing the mini games and going through the story, the player should be able to draw their own conclusions and be able to achieve the learning objectives.

## Story (Brief)

In the late 1840's a family's home burns down and they can't afford the repairs or buy a new one, so they head West in search of opportunity. Along their journey, they hunt some beavers to get enough money for the whole journey. They take a train, but are forced to stop at the Mississipi River. They sail across the river and eventually run into a squatter. They help repair the squatter's wagon and in exhange, get horses. When they finally reach the West Coast (California), their hardship pays off because they find enough gold in a stream to give them the life they could only dream of.

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*


# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

The game will be similar in aesthetics to subway surfer. We want it to be visually appealing with colors that are not too harsh (i.e a black and white game with red numbers). In terms of gameplay it will play similar to an RPG, with mini side-scroll and 'click to interact' type games mixed in to give it a fun twist.


## Graphical

- Characters List
  - The character's family
  - The beavers
  - Squatter Thomas
  - Merchant

- Textures:
  - Font for the game text: something western or old-fashioned.
  - Font for the answers: same as above
- Environment Art/Textures:
  - Background: The backgrounds will change depending on the minigame. Most likely I will draw these backgrounds as I enjoy the art side of the project.


## Audio

- Music List (Ambient sound)
  - Menus: Something that fits with the western theme.
  - In game: Music will change depending on the mini-game.
- Sound List (SFX)
  - sounds for the minigames
    - water
    - collisions
    - soil rustling
    - animal noises
